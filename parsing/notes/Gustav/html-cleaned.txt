<h1>Business Model Canvas</h1>
<h1>Value Proposition Canvas</h1>
<p>The Value Proposition Canvas has two sides:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Customer Profile:</strong> Clarifies your customer understanding</li>
<li><strong>Value Map:</strong> Describes the intend to create value for that customer</li>
</ol>
<p>Fit is achieved between the two when one meets the other.</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" src="Business%20Model%20Canvas%2053afda21164c4b989d435b99d090b208/Untitled.png" /></p>
<h2>Customer Profile</h2>
<p>The Customer (segment) Profile describes a specific Customer Segment in a business model in a structured and detailed way.</p>
<p>It breaks the customer down into its jobs, pains and gains.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Jobs (job-to-be-done):</strong> Describe what the customer are trying to get done in their work and lives, as expressed in their own words.</li>
<li><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong>Pains:<strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong> Describe bad outcomes, risks, and obstacles related to customer jobs.</li>
<li><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong>Gains:<strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong> Describe the outcomes customers want to achieve or the concrete benefits they are seeking.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Customer Jobs</h3>
<p>We can distinguish between 3 main types of Customer Jobs and Supporting Jobs:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Job Type</th>
<th>Definition</th>
<th>Examples</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Functional Jobs</td>
<td>When your customer try to perform or complete a specific task or solve a specific problem.</td>
<td>Mow the lawn, eat healthy, write a report, help clients</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Social Jobs</td>
<td>When your customer want to look good or gain power or status.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Describes how customers want to be perceived by others. | Look trendy, be perceived as competent |
| Personal/Emotional Jobs | When your customer seek a specific emotional state | Feeling good, secure, peace of mind |</p>
<h2>Value Map</h2>
<p>The Value (Proposition) Map describes the features of a specific Value Proposition in a business model in a structured and detailed way.</p>
<p>It breaks a Value Proposition down into products and services, pain relievers, and gain creators.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Products and Services:</strong> Is a list of all the products/services a Value Proposition is built around.</li>
<li><strong>Pain Relievers:</strong> Describe how the products and services alleviate customer pains.</li>
<li><strong>Gain Creators:</strong> Describe how the products and services create customer gains.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Business Model Canvas (BMC)</h1>
<p>The Business Model Canvas is a tool used to get an overview over existing or new business models and consist of 9 building blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Customer Segments</li>
<li>Value Propositions</li>
<li>Channels</li>
<li>Customer Relationships</li>
<li>Revenue Streams</li>
<li>Key Resources</li>
<li>Key Activities</li>
<li>Key Partnerships</li>
<li>Cost Structure</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Untitled" src="Business%20Model%20Canvas%2053afda21164c4b989d435b99d090b208/Untitled%203.png" /></p>
<h2>Customer Segments</h2>
<p>Defines the different groups of people/organizations an enterprise aims to reach and serve.</p>
<p>To better satisfy customers, a company may group them into distinct segments with common needs, behaviors, or other attributes.</p>
<h3>Customer Segment Types</h3>
<p>There are different types of Customer Segments:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Mass Market</td>
<td>BMCs focused on mass markets don’t distinguish between different Customer Segments.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The other building blocks focus on one large group of customers with broadly similar needs and problems.</p>
<p>Is often found in the consumer electronics sector |
| Niche Market | BMCs targeting niche markets cater to specific, specialized Customer Segments.</p>
<p>The other building blocks are all tailored to the specific requirements of a niche market.</p>
<p>Are often found in supplier-buyer relationships. E.g., car part manufacturers depend on purchases from major car manufactures- |
| Segmented | Some BMCs distinguish between market segments with slightly different needs and problems. |
| Diversified | An organization with this BMC serves two unrelated Customer Segments with very different needs and problems.</p>
<p>E.g. Amazon decided to diversify its retail business by selling cloud computing services. |
| Multi-sided platforms (or multi-sided markets) | Some organizations serve two or more interdependent Customer Segments. |</p>
<h2>Value Proposition</h2>
<p>Describes the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific Customer Segment. It is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason why customers turn to one company over another</li>
<li>Solves a customer problem or satisfies a customer need.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Value Proposition consists of a selected bundle of products/services that caters to the requirements of a specific Customer Segment.</p>
<h3>Customer Value Creation</h3>
<p>The following elements can contribute to Customer Value Creation:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Element</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Newness</td>
<td>Some Value Propositions satisfy an entirely new set of needs that customers previously didn’t perceive.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Is often technology related. |
| Performance | Improving product or service performance has been a common way to create value. |
| Customization | Tailoring products and services to the specific needs of individual customers or Customer Segments creates value. |
| “Getting the job done” | Value can be created simply by helping a customer get certain jobs done. |
| Design | Design is an important but difficult element to measure.
A product may stand out because of superior design. |
| Brand/Status | Customers may find value in the act of using and displaying a specific brand. |
| Price | Offering similar value at a lower price is a common way to satisfy the needs of price-sensitive Customer Segments.</p>
<p>Low-price Value Propositions have important implications for the rest of a business model. |
| Cost Reduction | Helping customers reduce costs is an important way to create value. |
| Risk Reduction | Customers value reducing the risks they incur when purchasing products or services |
| Accessibility | Making products and services available to customers who previously lacked access to them.</p>
<p>Can result from business model innovation, new technologies or a combination of both. |
| Convenience/Usability | Making thongs more convenient or easier to use can create substantial value. |</p>
<h2>Channels</h2>
<p>Describes how a company communicates with and reaches its Customer Segments to deliver a Value Proposition. </p>
<p>It is comprised by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication, distribution, and sales Channels</li>
<li>Channels are customer touch points that play an important role in the customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Channels serve several functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising awareness among customers about a company’s products and services.</li>
<li>Helping customers evaluate a company’s Value Proposition</li>
<li>Allowing customers to purchase specific products and services.</li>
<li>Providing post-purchase customer support.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Channel Phases</h3>
<p>Channels have 5 distinct phases. Each channel can cover some or all phases.</p>
<p>We distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct/Indirect channels</li>
<li>Owned/Partner channels</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding the right mix of Channels to satisfy how customers want to be reached is crucial in bringing a value proposition to market.</p>
<p><img alt="Untitled" src="Business%20Model%20Canvas%2053afda21164c4b989d435b99d090b208/Untitled%204.png" /></p>
<h2>Customer Relationships</h2>
<p>Describes the types of relationships a company wants to establish with each Customer Segment.</p>
<p>Relationships can range from personal to automated.</p>
<p>Customer Relationships may be driven by the following motivations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer Acquisition</li>
<li>Customer Retention</li>
<li>Boosting Sales (upselling)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Customer Relationships called for by a company’s business model deeply influence the overall customer experience.</p>
<h3>Customer Relationship Categories</h3>
<p>We can distinguish between several categories of Customer Relationships, which may co-exist in a company’s relationship with a particular Customer Segment:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Category</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Personal Assistance</td>
<td>Is based on human interaction.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Customer can communicate with a real customer representative to get help during the sales process or after the purchase.</p>
<p>May happen onsite at the point of sale, through call centers, by email, or through other means. |
| Dedicated Personal Assistance | Involves dedicating a customer representative specifically to an individual client.</p>
<p>Represents the deepest and most intimate type of relationship and normally develops over a long period of time.</p>
<p>E.g., Personal bankers |
| Self-service | A company maintains no direct relationship with customers.</p>
<p>Provides all the necessary means for customers to help themselves. |
| Automated Services | Mixes a sophisticated form of customer self-service with automated processes.</p>
<p>E.g., Personal online profiles give customers access to customized services |
| Communities | Increasingly, companies are utilizing user communities to become more involved with customers/prospects and to facilitate connections between community members.</p>
<p>Users exchange knowledge and solve each other’s problems.</p>
<p>Can help companies better understand their customers. |
| Co-creation | More companies are going beyond the traditional customer-vendor relationship to co-create value with customers.</p>
<p>E.g., Amazon invites customers to write reviews and create value for other book lovers. |</p>
<h2>Revenue Streams</h2>
<p>Represents the cash a company generates from each Customer Segment (cost must be subtracted from revenues to create earnings).</p>
<p>A company must ask itself, “<em>For what value is each Customer Segment willing to pay?</em>”</p>
<p>Successfully answering the question allows the firm to generate one or more Revenue Streams from each Customer Segment. Each stream may have different pricing mechanisms.</p>
<p>A business model can involve two different types of Revenue Streams:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transaction Revenues:</strong> Resulting from one-time customer payments.</li>
<li><strong>Recurring Revenues:</strong> Resulting from ongoing payments to either deliver a Value Proposition to customers or provide post-purchase customer support</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ways to generate Revenue Streams</h3>
<p>There are several ways to generate Revenue Streams:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Revenue Stream</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Asset Sale</td>
<td>Derives from selling ownership rights to a physical product.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Usage Fee</td>
<td>Is generated by the use of a particular service.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The more a service is used, the more the customer pays. |
| Subscription Fees | Is generated by selling continuous access to a service. |
| Licensing | Is generated by giving customers permission to use protected IP in exchange for licensing fees.</p>
<p>Licensing allows right-holders to generate revenues from their property without having to manufacture a product or commercialize a service. |
| Brokerage Fees | Derives from intermediation services performed on behalf of two or more parties.</p>
<p>E.g., Credit card providers, earn revenues by taking a percentage of the value of each sales transaction executed between credit card merchants and customers. |
| Advertising | Results from fees for advertising a particular product, service, or brand |</p>
<h3>Pricing Mechanisms</h3>
<p>Each Revenue Stream might have different pricing mechanisms.</p>
<p>The type of pricing mechanism chosen can make a big difference in terms of revenues generated.</p>
<p>There are two main types of pricing mechanisms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fixed Pricing</li>
<li>Dynamic Pricing</li>
</ol>
<p>| Fixed Menu Pricing
(Predefined prices are based on static variables) | Dynamic Pricing
(Prices change based on market conditions) |
| --- | --- |
| List Price
Fixed prices for individual products, services, or other Value Propositions | Negotiation (Bargaining)
Price negotiated between two or more partners depending on negotiation power and/or negotiation skills. |
| Product Feature Dependent
Price depends on the number of quality of Value Proposition features | Yield Management
Price depends on inventory and time of purchase (normally used for hotel rooms or airline seats) |
| Customer Segment Dependent
Price depends on the type and characteristic of a Customer Segment | Real-time-market
Price is stablished dynamically based on supply and demand. |
| Volume Dependent
Price as a function of the quantity purchased | Auctions
Price determined by outcome of competitive bidding |</p>
<h2>Key Resources</h2>
<p>Describes the most important assets required to make a business model work.</p>
<p>Every business model requires Key Resources that allow an enterprise to create and offer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain relationships with Customer Segments, and earn revenues.</p>
<p>Different Key Resources are needed depending on the type of business model.</p>
<p>Key Resources can be: physical, financial, intellectual, or human.
They can be owned or leased by the company or acquired from Key Partners.</p>
<h3>Key Resources Categories</h3>
<p>The following are different Key Resources categories:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Key Resource</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Physical</td>
<td>Includes physical assets such as manufacturing facilities, buildings, vehicles, machines, systems, point-of-sales systems, and distribution networks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intellectual</td>
<td>Are brands, proprietary knowledge, patens, copyrights, partnerships and customer databases are increasingly important components of a strong business model.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Intellectual resources are difficult to develop but when successfully created may offer substantial value.  |
| Human | Every enterprise requires human resources, but people are particularly prominent in certain business models. |
| Financial | Some business models call for financial resources and/or financial guarantees such as cash, lines of credit, or a stock option pool for hiring key employees. |</p>
<h2>Key Activities</h2>
<p>Describes the most important things a company must do to make its business model work.</p>
<p>every business model calls for a number of Key Activities. They are the most important actions a company must take to operate successfully.</p>
<p>They are required to create and offer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain Customer Relationships, and earn revenues.</p>
<p>Key Activities differ depending on the business model type.</p>
<h3>Key Activities Categories</h3>
<p>Key Activities can be categorized as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Key Activity</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Production</td>
<td>Relate to designing, making, and delivering a product in substantial quantities and/or of superior quality.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Production activity dominates the business model of manufacturing firms. |
| Problem Solving | Relate to coming up with new solutions to individual customer problems. |
| Platform/Network | Business models designed with a platform as a Key Resources are dominated by platform or network related Key Activities. |</p>
<h2>Key Partnerships</h2>
<p>Describes the network of suppliers and partners that make the business model work.</p>
<p>Companies forge partnerships for many reasons, and partnerships are becoming a cornerstone of many business models.</p>
<p>Companies create alliances to optimize their business models, reduce risk, or acquire resources.</p>
<p>We distinguish between 4 different types of partnerships:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strategic alliances between non-competitors</li>
<li>Coopetition: Strategic partnerships between competitors</li>
<li>Joint ventures to develop new businesses</li>
<li>Buyer-supplier relationships to assure reliable supplies</li>
</ol>
<h3>Motivations for Creating Partnerships</h3>
<p>The following are 3 motivations for creating partnerships:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Motivation</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Optimization and Economy of Scale</td>
<td>Most basic form of partnership or buyer-supplier relationship is designed to optimize the allocation of resources and activities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reduction of Risk and Uncertainty</td>
<td>Partnerships can help reduce risk in a competitive environment characterized by uncertainty.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It is not unusual for competitors to form a strategic alliance in one area while competing in another. |
| Acquisition of Particular Resources and Activities | Few companies own all the resources or perform all the activities described by their business models.</p>
<p>They extend their own capabilities by relying on other forms to furnish resources or perform certain activities.</p>
<p>Such partnerships can be motivated by needs to acquire knowledge, licenses, or access to customers. |</p>
<h2>Cost Structure</h2>
<p>Describes all costs incurred to operate the business model. It describes the most important costs incurred while operating under a particular business model.</p>
<p>Creating and delivering value, maintaining Customer Relationships, and generating revenue all incur costs.</p>
<p>Such costs can be calculated relatively easily after defining Key Resources, Key Activities and Key Partnerships.</p>
<p>Some business models are more cost-driven than others.</p>
<h3>Cost Structure Types and Characteristics</h3>
<p>We can distinguish between two broad classes of business model Cost Structures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cost-driven Cost Structure</li>
<li>Value-driven Cost Structure</li>
</ol>
<p>Many business models fall in between the two extremes.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Cost-driven</td>
<td>Focus on minimizing costs wherever possible.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Aims at creating and maintaining the leanest possible Cost Structure, using low price Value Propositions, maximum automation, and extensive outsourcing. |
| Value-driven | Focus on value creation rather than cost implications of business model design.</p>
<p>Premium Value Propositions and high degree of personalized service characterizes value-driven business models. |</p>
<p>Cost Structures can have the following characteristics:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Characteristic</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Fixed Costs</td>
<td>Costs that remain the same despite of volume of goods or services produced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Variable Costs</td>
<td>Costs that vary proportionally with the volume of goods or services produced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Economies of Scale</td>
<td>Cost advantages that a business enjoys as its output expands.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Larger companies benefit from lower bulk purchase rates. This and other factors cause average cost per unit to fall as output rises. |
| Economies of Scope | Cost advantages that a business enjoys due to a larger scope of operations. |</p>
<h1>BMC for non-profit organizations</h1>
<p><a href="Business%20Model%20Canvas%2053afda21164c4b989d435b99d090b208/Business_Model_Generation_p._264_(non-profit_organizations_and_BMC).pdf">Business Model Generation p. 264 (non-profit organizations and BMC).pdf</a></p>
<p>Every organization that creates and delivers value most generate enough revenue to cover its expenses.</p>
<ul>
<li>For-profit organizations goals are to maximize earnings</li>
<li>Third-party funded enterprises and Triple Bottom Line business models focus on ecology, social causes, and public service mandates.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can distinguish between two not-for-profit organizations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Third-party Funded Enterprise Models</strong><ol>
<li>Philanthropy, charities, government</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Triple Bottom Line</strong><ol>
<li>Has strong ecological and/or social mission</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Third-Party Funded Models</h3>
<p>In this enterprise model:</p>
<ul>
<li>The product or service recipient is not the payer</li>
<li>Products and services are paid for by a third party, which might be a donor or the public sector.</li>
<li>Revenues Streams often comes from donors</li>
<li>The Third-party model has a mission instead of a Value Proposition</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> The main financer becomes the main “customer” while the recipient becomes a mere receiver.<ul>
<li>Business focus more on creating value for donors than for recipients</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
