<h1>
 Value Proposition Canvas
</h1>
<p>
 The Value Proposition Canvas has two sides:
</p>
<ol>
 Customer Profile: Clarifies your customer understandingValue Map: Describes the intend to create value for that customer
</ol>
<p>
 Fit is achieved between the two when one meets the other.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>
 Customer Profile
</h2>
<p>
 The Customer (segment) Profile describes a specific Customer Segment in a business model in a structured and detailed way.
</p>
<p>
 It breaks the customer down into its jobs, pains and gains.
</p>
<ul>
 Customer Jobs (job-to-be-done): Describe what the customer are trying to get done in their work and lives, as expressed in their own words.Pains: Describe bad outcomes, risks, and obstacles related to customer jobs.Gains: Describe the outcomes customers want to achieve or the concrete benefits they are seeking.
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
 Customer Jobs
</h3>
<p>
 We can distinguish between 3 main types of Customer Jobs and Supporting Jobs:
</p>
<table>
 Job TypeDefinitionExamplesFunctional JobsWhen your customer try to perform or complete a specific task or solve a specific problem.Mow the lawn, eat healthy, write a report, help clientsSocial JobsWhen your customer want to look good or gain power or status.

</p>
<h2>
 Value Map
</h2>
<p>
 The Value (Proposition) Map describes the features of a specific Value Proposition in a business model in a structured and detailed way.
</p>
<p>
 It breaks a Value Proposition down into products and services, pain relievers, and gain creators.
</p>
<ul>
 Products and Services: Is a list of all the products/services a Value Proposition is built around.Pain Relievers: Describe how the products and services alleviate customer pains.Gain Creators: Describe how the products and services create customer gains.
</ul>
<p>

 Business Model Canvas (BMC)
</h1>
<p>
 The Business Model Canvas is a tool used to get an overview over existing or new business models and consist of 9 building blocks:
</p>
<ol>
 Customer SegmentsValue PropositionsChannelsCustomer RelationshipsRevenue StreamsKey ResourcesKey ActivitiesKey PartnershipsCost Structure
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<h2>
 Customer Segments
</h2>
<p>
 Defines the different groups of people/organizations an enterprise aims to reach and serve.
</p>
<p>
 To better satisfy customers, a company may group them into distinct segments with common needs, behaviors, or other attributes.
</p>
<h3>
 Customer Segment Types
</h3>
<p>
 There are different types of Customer Segments:
</p>
<table>
 TypeDefinitionMass MarketBMCs focused on mass markets don’t distinguish between different Customer Segments.
</table>
<p>
 The other building blocks focus on one large group of customers with broadly similar needs and problems.
</p>
<p>
 Is often found in the consumer electronics sector | | Niche Market | BMCs targeting niche markets cater to specific, specialized Customer Segments.
</p>
<p>
 The other building blocks are all tailored to the specific requirements of a niche market.
</p>
<p>
 Are often found in supplier-buyer relationships. E.g., car part manufacturers depend on purchases from major car manufactures- | | Segmented | Some BMCs distinguish between market segments with slightly different needs and problems. | | Diversified | An organization with this BMC serves two unrelated Customer Segments with very different needs and problems.
</p>
<p>
 E.g. Amazon decided to diversify its retail business by selling cloud computing services. | | Multi-sided platforms (or multi-sided markets) | Some organizations serve two or more interdependent Customer Segments. |
</p>
<h2>
 Value Proposition
</h2>
<p>
 Describes the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific Customer Segment. It is:
</p>
<ul>
 The reason why customers turn to one company over anotherSolves a customer problem or satisfies a customer need.
</ul>
<p>
 Each Value Proposition consists of a selected bundle of products/services that caters to the requirements of a specific Customer Segment.
</p>
<h3>
 Customer Value Creation
</h3>
<p>
 The following elements can contribute to Customer Value Creation:
</p>
<table>
 ElementValueNewnessSome Value Propositions satisfy an entirely new set of needs that customers previously didn’t perceive.
</table>
<p>
 Is often technology related. | | Performance | Improving product or service performance has been a common way to create value. | | Customization | Tailoring products and services to the specific needs of individual customers or Customer Segments creates value. | | “Getting the job done” | Value can be created simply by helping a customer get certain jobs done. | | Design | Design is an important but difficult element to measure. A product may stand out because of superior design. | | Brand/Status | Customers may find value in the act of using and displaying a specific brand. | | Price | Offering similar value at a lower price is a common way to satisfy the needs of price-sensitive Customer Segments.
</p>
<p>
 Low-price Value Propositions have important implications for the rest of a business model. | | Cost Reduction | Helping customers reduce costs is an important way to create value. | | Risk Reduction | Customers value reducing the risks they incur when purchasing products or services | | Accessibility | Making products and services available to customers who previously lacked access to them.
</p>
<p>
 Can result from business model innovation, new technologies or a combination of both. | | Convenience/Usability | Making thongs more convenient or easier to use can create substantial value. |
</p>
<h2>
 Channels
</h2>
<p>
 Describes how a company communicates with and reaches its Customer Segments to deliver a Value Proposition.
</p>
<p>
 It is comprised by:
</p>
<ul>
 Communication, distribution, and sales ChannelsChannels are customer touch points that play an important role in the customer experience.
</ul>
<p>
 Channels serve several functions:
</p>
<ul>
 Raising awareness among customers about a company’s products and services.Helping customers evaluate a company’s Value PropositionAllowing customers to purchase specific products and services.Providing post-purchase customer support.
</ul>
<h3>
 Channel Phases
</h3>
<p>
 Channels have 5 distinct phases. Each channel can cover some or all phases.
</p>
<p>
 We distinguish between:
</p>
<ul>
 Direct/Indirect channelsOwned/Partner channels
</ul>
<p>
 Finding the right mix of Channels to satisfy how customers want to be reached is crucial in bringing a value proposition to market.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>
 Customer Relationships
</h2>
<p>
 Describes the types of relationships a company wants to establish with each Customer Segment.
</p>
<p>
 Relationships can range from personal to automated.
</p>
<p>
 Customer Relationships may be driven by the following motivations:
</p>
<ul>
 Customer AcquisitionCustomer RetentionBoosting Sales (upselling)
</ul>
<p>
 The Customer Relationships called for by a company’s business model deeply influence the overall customer experience.
</p>
<h3>
 Customer Relationship Categories
</h3>
<p>
 We can distinguish between several categories of Customer Relationships, which may co-exist in a company’s relationship with a particular Customer Segment:
</p>
<table>
 CategoryDefinitionPersonal AssistanceIs based on human interaction.
</table>
<p>
 Customer can communicate with a real customer representative to get help during the sales process or after the purchase.
</p>
<p>
 May happen onsite at the point of sale, through call centers, by email, or through other means. | | Dedicated Personal Assistance | Involves dedicating a customer representative specifically to an individual client.
</p>
<p>
 Represents the deepest and most intimate type of relationship and normally develops over a long period of time.
</p>
<p>
 E.g., Personal bankers | | Self-service | A company maintains no direct relationship with customers.
</p>
<p>
 Provides all the necessary means for customers to help themselves. | | Automated Services | Mixes a sophisticated form of customer self-service with automated processes.
</p>
<p>
 E.g., Personal online profiles give customers access to customized services | | Communities | Increasingly, companies are utilizing user communities to become more involved with customers/prospects and to facilitate connections between community members.
</p>
<p>
 Users exchange knowledge and solve each other’s problems.
</p>
<p>
 Can help companies better understand their customers. | | Co-creation | More companies are going beyond the traditional customer-vendor relationship to co-create value with customers.
</p>
<p>
 E.g., Amazon invites customers to write reviews and create value for other book lovers. |
</p>
<h2>
 Revenue Streams
</h2>
<p>
 Represents the cash a company generates from each Customer Segment (cost must be subtracted from revenues to create earnings).
</p>
<p>
 A company must ask itself, “For what value is each Customer Segment willing to pay?”
</p>
<p>
 Successfully answering the question allows the firm to generate one or more Revenue Streams from each Customer Segment. Each stream may have different pricing mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
 A business model can involve two different types of Revenue Streams:
</p>
<ul>
 Transaction Revenues: Resulting from one-time customer payments.Recurring Revenues: Resulting from ongoing payments to either deliver a Value Proposition to customers or provide post-purchase customer support
</ul>
<h3>
 Ways to generate Revenue Streams
</h3>
<p>
 There are several ways to generate Revenue Streams:
</p>
<table>
 Revenue StreamDefinitionAsset SaleDerives from selling ownership rights to a physical product.Usage FeeIs generated by the use of a particular service.
</table>
<p>
 The more a service is used, the more the customer pays. | | Subscription Fees | Is generated by selling continuous access to a service. | | Licensing | Is generated by giving customers permission to use protected IP in exchange for licensing fees.
</p>
<p>
 Licensing allows right-holders to generate revenues from their property without having to manufacture a product or commercialize a service. | | Brokerage Fees | Derives from intermediation services performed on behalf of two or more parties.
</p>
<p>
 E.g., Credit card providers, earn revenues by taking a percentage of the value of each sales transaction executed between credit card merchants and customers. | | Advertising | Results from fees for advertising a particular product, service, or brand |
</p>
<h3>
 Pricing Mechanisms
</h3>
<p>
 Each Revenue Stream might have different pricing mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
 The type of pricing mechanism chosen can make a big difference in terms of revenues generated.
</p>
<p>
 There are two main types of pricing mechanisms:
</p>
<ol>
 Fixed PricingDynamic Pricing
</ol>
<p>
 | Fixed Menu Pricing (Predefined prices are based on static variables) | Dynamic Pricing (Prices change based on market conditions) | | --- | --- | | List Price Fixed prices for individual products, services, or other Value Propositions | Negotiation (Bargaining) Price negotiated between two or more partners depending on negotiation power and/or negotiation skills. | | Product Feature Dependent Price depends on the number of quality of Value Proposition features | Yield Management Price depends on inventory and time of purchase (normally used for hotel rooms or airline seats) | | Customer Segment Dependent Price depends on the type and characteristic of a Customer Segment | Real-time-market Price is stablished dynamically based on supply and demand. | | Volume Dependent Price as a function of the quantity purchased | Auctions Price determined by outcome of competitive bidding |
</p>
<h2>
 Key Resources
</h2>
<p>
 Describes the most important assets required to make a business model work.
</p>
<p>
 Every business model requires Key Resources that allow an enterprise to create and offer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain relationships with Customer Segments, and earn revenues.
</p>
<p>
 Different Key Resources are needed depending on the type of business model.
</p>
<p>
 Key Resources can be: physical, financial, intellectual, or human. They can be owned or leased by the company or acquired from Key Partners.
</p>
<h3>
 Key Resources Categories
</h3>
<p>
 The following are different Key Resources categories:
</p>
<table>
 Key ResourceDefinitionPhysicalIncludes physical assets such as manufacturing facilities, buildings, vehicles, machines, systems, point-of-sales systems, and distribution networks.IntellectualAre brands, proprietary knowledge, patens, copyrights, partnerships and customer databases are increasingly important components of a strong business model.
</table>
<p>
 Intellectual resources are difficult to develop but when successfully created may offer substantial value.  | | Human | Every enterprise requires human resources, but people are particularly prominent in certain business models. | | Financial | Some business models call for financial resources and/or financial guarantees such as cash, lines of credit, or a stock option pool for hiring key employees. |
</p>
<h2>
 Key Activities
</h2>
<p>
 Describes the most important things a company must do to make its business model work.
</p>
<p>
 every business model calls for a number of Key Activities. They are the most important actions a company must take to operate successfully.
</p>
<p>
 They are required to create and offer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain Customer Relationships, and earn revenues.
</p>
<p>
 Key Activities differ depending on the business model type.
</p>
<h3>
 Key Activities Categories
</h3>
<p>
 Key Activities can be categorized as follows:
</p>
<table>
 Key ActivityDefinitionProductionRelate to designing, making, and delivering a product in substantial quantities and/or of superior quality.
</table>
<p>
 Production activity dominates the business model of manufacturing firms. | | Problem Solving | Relate to coming up with new solutions to individual customer problems. | | Platform/Network | Business models designed with a platform as a Key Resources are dominated by platform or network related Key Activities. |
</p>
<h2>
 Key Partnerships
</h2>
<p>
 Describes the network of suppliers and partners that make the business model work.
</p>
<p>
 Companies forge partnerships for many reasons, and partnerships are becoming a cornerstone of many business models.
</p>
<p>
 Companies create alliances to optimize their business models, reduce risk, or acquire resources.
</p>
<p>
 We distinguish between 4 different types of partnerships:
</p>
<ol>
 Strategic alliances between non-competitorsCoopetition: Strategic partnerships between competitorsJoint ventures to develop new businessesBuyer-supplier relationships to assure reliable supplies
</ol>
<h3>
 Motivations for Creating Partnerships
</h3>
<p>
 The following are 3 motivations for creating partnerships:
</p>
<table>
 MotivationDefinitionOptimization and Economy of ScaleMost basic form of partnership or buyer-supplier relationship is designed to optimize the allocation of resources and activities.Reduction of Risk and UncertaintyPartnerships can help reduce risk in a competitive environment characterized by uncertainty.
</table>
<p>
 It is not unusual for competitors to form a strategic alliance in one area while competing in another. | | Acquisition of Particular Resources and Activities | Few companies own all the resources or perform all the activities described by their business models.
</p>
<p>
 They extend their own capabilities by relying on other forms to furnish resources or perform certain activities.
</p>
<p>
 Such partnerships can be motivated by needs to acquire knowledge, licenses, or access to customers. |
</p>
<h2>
 Cost Structure
</h2>
<p>
 Describes all costs incurred to operate the business model. It describes the most important costs incurred while operating under a particular business model.
</p>
<p>
 Creating and delivering value, maintaining Customer Relationships, and generating revenue all incur costs.
</p>
<p>
 Such costs can be calculated relatively easily after defining Key Resources, Key Activities and Key Partnerships.
</p>
<p>
 Some business models are more cost-driven than others.
</p>
<h3>
 Cost Structure Types and Characteristics
</h3>
<p>
 We can distinguish between two broad classes of business model Cost Structures:
</p>
<ol>
 Cost-driven Cost StructureValue-driven Cost Structure
</ol>
<p>
 Many business models fall in between the two extremes.
</p>
<table>
 TypeDefinitionCost-drivenFocus on minimizing costs wherever possible.
</table>
<p>
 Aims at creating and maintaining the leanest possible Cost Structure, using low price Value Propositions, maximum automation, and extensive outsourcing. | | Value-driven | Focus on value creation rather than cost implications of business model design.
</p>
<p>
 Premium Value Propositions and high degree of personalized service characterizes value-driven business models. |
</p>
<p>
 Cost Structures can have the following characteristics:
</p>
<table>
 CharacteristicDefinitionFixed CostsCosts that remain the same despite of volume of goods or services produced.Variable CostsCosts that vary proportionally with the volume of goods or services produced.Economies of ScaleCost advantages that a business enjoys as its output expands.
</table>
<p>
 Larger companies benefit from lower bulk purchase rates. This and other factors cause average cost per unit to fall as output rises. | | Economies of Scope | Cost advantages that a business enjoys due to a larger scope of operations. |
</p>

 BMC for non-profit organizations
</h1>
<p>
 Business Model Generation p. 264 (non-profit organizations and BMC).pdf
</p>
<p>
 Every organization that creates and delivers value most generate enough revenue to cover its expenses.
</p>
<ul>
 For-profit organizations goals are to maximize earningsThird-party funded enterprises and Triple Bottom Line business models focus on ecology, social causes, and public service mandates.
</ul>
<p>
 We can distinguish between two not-for-profit organizations:
</p>
<ol>
 Third-party Funded Enterprise ModelsPhilanthropy, charities, governmentTriple Bottom LineHas strong ecological and/or social mission
</ol>
<h3>
 Third-Party Funded Models
</h3>
<p>
 In this enterprise model:
</p>
<ul>
 The product or service recipient is not the payerProducts and services are paid for by a third party, which might be a donor or the public sector.Revenues Streams often comes from donorsThe Third-party model has a mission instead of a Value PropositionRisk: The main financer becomes the main “customer” while the recipient becomes a mere receiver.Business focus more on creating value for donors than for recipients
