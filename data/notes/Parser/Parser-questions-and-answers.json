Knowledge acquisition activity Collect data, organize it into information and formalize it into knowledge. Rational driven activity Captures the context in which decisions were made, and the rationale behind said decisions. Requirement engineering Used in a plan-driven process like waterfall. Requirement Elicitation Identifies and discovers the requirements from the client (using elicitation techniques mentioned later on like interview, prototyping and ethnography) Requirement Analysis Transforms the data taken from the elicitation phase to useful information and requirements to the system.",
