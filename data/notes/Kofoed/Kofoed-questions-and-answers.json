		"context": "Problem with realization (or physical implementation). As we remember, Turing machines were originally planned only as a thought experiment. But today they are implemented physically. Implementation is a mapping of an abstract specification to a physical object, such that the states of the abstract objects match the states of the physical objects. Additionally, every transition between states of the abstract object maps onto a transition of the physical object. This common-sense description leads to \u201cpancomputionalism\u201d. There are more complex definitions of \u201cimplementation\u201d, but they are still not considered Turing machines were mechanical and \u201cmindless\u201d by design. But Turing himself suggested that they can match human intelligence.",
