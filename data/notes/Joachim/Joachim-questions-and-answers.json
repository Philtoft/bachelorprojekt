Some of the important points are as follows: Different people approach AI with different goals in mind. Two important questions toask are: Are you concerned with thinking or behavior? Do you want to model humansor work from an ideal standard: In this book, we adopt the view that intelligence is concerned mainly with rationalaction. Ideally, an intelligent agent takes the best possible action in a situation. Westudy the problem of building agents that are intelligent in this sense.",
